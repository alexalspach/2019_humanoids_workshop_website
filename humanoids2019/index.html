				<h2><strong>Objectives</strong></h2>
				<!--<h2><strong>Call For Contributions</strong></h2>-->
				<p>We are excited to announce the 5th workshop titled <i>Can we build Baymax?</i> Part V. Since the first workshop was organized in 2015, our workshop series has taken place at the IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots <a target="_blank" href="http://humanoids2019.loria.fr/">(Humanoids 2019)</a> every year. Baymax is a humanoid character in the Disney feature animation Big Hero 6. It is a healthcare robot with an inflatable body, capable of walking, bumping into surrounding objects, learning motions and physically interacting with people. However, in the real world, it is not easy to build such a robot. In the previous workshops, we have discussed topics on mechanisms and structure, sensors, protection, control, soft robot fabrication, fail-safe systems and learning for humanoid robots. As a continuation of the discussion, this workshop will bring together researchers looking for paths toward seamless communication between humans and humanoid robots like Baymax. In particular, we will tackle challenges in rendering and interpreting diverse types of interactions from hardware and software points of view including but not limited to gestures, touching and hugging, facial expressions, speech, body language, and eye contact.</p>


				<p>We invite you to contribute and to participate in this workshop.</p>

				<br>
 
				<strong>The workshop's topics include, but are not limited to:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Cognitive sciences for social robots</li>
					<li>Multi-modal human-robot communication</li>
					<li>Socially assistive robots to improve quality of life</li>
					<li>Human monitoring and intention recognition</li>
					<li>Expressive robot hardware</li>
					<li>Humanoids for interactive medical and health care</li>
					<li>Social and ethical issues</li>

						<h2>David Hanson</h2>

						<p>David Hanson develops robots that are widely regarded as the world’s most human-like in appearance, in a lifelong quest to create true living, caring machines. To accomplish these goals, Hanson integrates figurative arts with cognitive science and robotics engineering, inventions novel skin materials, facial expression mechanisms, and collaborative developments in AI, within humanoid artworks like Sophia the robot, which can engage people in naturalistic face-to-face conversations and currently serve in AI research, education, therapy, and other uses.</p>

						<p>Hanson worked as a Walt Disney Imagineer, both a sculptor and a technical consultant in robotics, and later founded Hanson Robotics. As a researcher, Hanson published dozens of papers in materials science, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and robotics journals — including SPIE, IEEE, the International Journal of Cognitive Science, IROS, AAAI, AI magazine and more. He wrote two books including “Humanizing Robots” and received several patents. Hanson was featured in the New York Times, Popular Science, Scientific American, WIRED, BBC and CNN. He also received earned awards from NASA, NSF, Tech Titans’ Innovator of the Year, RISD, Cooper Hewitt Design Triennial, and the co-received the 2005 AAAI first place prize for open interaction of an AI system. Hanson holds a Ph.D. in Interactive Arts and Technology from the University of Texas at Dallas, and a BFA in film Animation video from the Rhode Island School of Design.</p>
